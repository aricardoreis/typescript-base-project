# typescript-base-project

Base repository for typescript projects.

The main purpose of this repository is to be a basic template for node projects using typescript. The purpose is not to be a comprehensive project, it's just to be a good start for new projects. If you are interested in starting a new TypeScript project - check out the bootstrapping tools reference in [the TypeScript Website](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html).
